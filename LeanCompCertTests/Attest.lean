# The receipt standard, exercised

What is tested here, and what deliberately is not.

**Tested in the kernel.**  The failure behaviour of `receiptBinds` on mutated
receipts — wrong value, replayed nonce, abnormal termination, disagreement,
regime confusion, route confusion, a substituted digest, a field edited after
signing, and an artifact that does not emit — and that the toy `ReceiptCrypto`
used below is *not* self-tested, so it cannot be mistaken for a deployment.

**Also tested in the kernel, and this is the part that used to be an axiom.**
That `Artifact.source?` evaluates at all, and that the receipt's `programHash`
is the digest of the emitted C — the *join*.  `decide +kernel` reduces the
emitter and both validators now; see `Artifact.source?` for the five kinds of
non-reducing definition that had to go.

**Not tested here, and why.**  The whole `receiptBinds … = true` in one goal.
It does close by `decide +kernel` — measured 54 s and 12.3 GB on this artifact
— but the cost is almost entirely the toy hash applied to `RunReceipt.payload`
(reducing `payload.length` alone is 28 s and 4.9 GB, because `payload` is built
by `String.intercalate` and Lean 4.32's `String` is UTF-8 bytes, so every
character read walks an append chain).  That is the receipt format's cost and
the crypto instance's, not the emitter's, and it does not grow with the size of
the computation.  Paying it on every build would buy no coverage the join test
below does not already give, so the shipped test stops at the join.

The mutation tests use the library's proved failure theorems rather than
`decide`.  They are stronger for it: they hold for every artifact, not for one.

The two facts that used to need an axiom.  `bound` in

discharged by a named axiom, and that one is the point of the whole design. -/

/-! ## The rolled route, covered end to end

The 10⁷-iteration rolled fixed-point certificate — the artifact that exists
because its unrolled form is multi-gigabyte C — accepted by
`receiptBindsProved`, whose extra clause is now a real coverage condition
rather than a route tag.  What comes out is a statement about the
counter-augmented program's ordinary Lean denotation. -/

namespace Rolled

open LeanCompCert.Testing.RolledFixedPoint

/-- The rolled artifact.  Note that no `Computation` is supplied: the rolled
form carries the program, and everything else is derived. -/
def artifact : Artifact := {
  body := .rolled program "FixedPoint.rolled10M"
  mainC := LeanCompCert.Testing.RolledFixedPoint.mainC
}

/-! This is the *same* C the `rolled-10m` certificate emits and `check-native`
compiles: `emitFor_rolled` says `emitFor (.rolled p e) m` is
`emitRolled p e >>= (· ++ m)`, which is `RolledFixedPoint.emittedC` written
out.  It is not asserted as a theorem here because identifying the two closed
terms sends the *elaborator* (not the kernel) into evaluating the emitted
string; `scripts/test-compcert.sh` checks the same identity on the bytes. -/

/-- **The coverage condition, decided.**  Program well-formedness and a trip
count below `2⁶⁴`; both program-sized, neither growing with the 10⁷
iterations. -/
theorem rolled_covered : artifact.coveredByProvedChain = true := by decide

/-- **The strict check imposes nothing extra on this artifact.**  On a rolled
artifact `receiptBindsProved` used to be identically `false`; here it reduces
to `receiptBinds`, so anything the plain check accepts the strict one accepts
too. -/

denotation. -/
theorem rolled_model_preserved :
    artifact.body.modelResult = artifact.body.sourceResult :=
  artifact.body.modelResult_eq_sourceResult rolled_covered

/-- **The emitter runs in the kernel for the rolled route too**, so the join

straight-line artifact. -/

/-- **The acceptance.**  `receiptBindsProved` — the strict form, demanding
coverage by the proved chain — applied to a rolled artifact, giving a fact
about the program's Lean-level denotation.  Before this change the strict form
refused every rolled artifact by construction. -/

end Rolled

/-! ## The tool's byte surgery

Round-tripping DER ↔ SEC1, DER ↔ `r ‖ s` and the receipt file is checked at
**run time**, in `LeanCompCertTests.testAttestTool`, not by `decide` here.
That is a deliberate placement: `ByteArray.foldl` and the string builders these
go through are not cheap for the kernel's evaluator (a `decide` over the
64-byte signature round trip was measured at tens of gigabytes), and nothing
about a receipt's *soundness* rests on them — a tool that mis-encodes produces
a signature the verifier rejects, so the failure is loud and is caught by
`receiptBinds`.
