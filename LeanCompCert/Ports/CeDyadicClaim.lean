# The dyadic prime-fold as a `ProgramClaim`

`Ports/CeDyadicFold.lean` proves what the register program denotes.  This
module packages that into the single implication a consumer needs, and states
the per-candidate term `ceTerm` in the shape the consumer's own certificate
term already has, so that the two can be identified by `rfl`.

## What this does and does not establish

`ProgramClaim.prove` takes a `Computation.Returns` hypothesis.  This module
neither creates nor admits one.  Everything below is an ordinary Lean theorem
about `Program.denote`; nothing here asserts that any physical execution
happened, and nothing here adds an axiom.

`CeDyadicFold.ceRun_spec` is proved, so `ceProgram_denote` and therefore
`ceClaim.sound` depend on nothing but the base trio.  Nothing below states an
axiom, and there is no `sorry` anywhere in this family.

## The per-candidate term

`ceTerm c n k` is the plain-`Nat` value one block of `R` rounds accumulates for
the candidate `n` carrying the dyadic exponent `k`.  It is written so that at
`c.up = 0` it reduces to the consumer's lower (max) term and at `c.up = 1` to
the consumer's upper (min) term, by `rfl` once `c` is a concrete instance.

**The consumer's entry point.**

If the compiled program returns the accepting value `1`, then the flat fold
reached the certified side of `bound` without any accumulator step wrapping.

Both halves are one-way, as they should be: a program that returned `0` would
say nothing, which is exactly what a certificate is entitled to.
