# Acceptance yields every candidate's check, and the two exact final sums

Layer four of the `G1215Check` port, and the last one that lives upstream.
`Ports/G1215CheckDenote.lean` proved that the program denotes the
epilogue-corrected good flag of the flat `gRound` fold;
`Ports/G1215CheckSpec.lean` proved that the flat fold re-blocks per candidate
and that one block is one candidate.  This module joins the two:

```text
(gProgram c).denote = some 1 →
  (∀ j < c.len, gAccU c j ≤ ACAP ∧ gAccL c j ≤ ACAP ∧
     candPass c (c.lo + j) (gAccU c j) (gAccL c j) = true) ∧
  gAccU c (c.len - 1) ≤ c.finU ∧ c.finL ≤ gAccL c (c.len - 1)
```

The good flag is only ever multiplied by `0/1` quantities, so a `1` at the end
forces a `1` at every block *and* at both of the epilogue's final-sum tests —
which is the one thing this port owes that the sibling `GFoldCheckSpec` does
not, its epilogue being empty.  The two accumulator caps come from the
`capOK` bit that a firing check re-tests, and they are what makes the `% M` in
`bAccU`/`bAccL` a no-op.

Nothing here evaluates a fold and nothing here is a certificate.
