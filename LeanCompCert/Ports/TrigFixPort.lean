# The fixed-point multiply-and-shift as an instruction block

`Verified/TrigFixed.lean` proves the trigonometric series terms correct as an
exact `Nat` bracket, and `mul62_eq` shows the scaling multiply needs no 128-bit
intermediate.  Neither of those is yet *code*: they are statements about `Nat`
functions.  This module supplies the instruction block and proves it computes
`mul62`, which is what an emitted program will actually run.

The block is `mulWideG` — the eighteen-instruction half-limb multiplier already
proved against `Verified.MulWide.hl` — followed by exactly three scalar
operations:

```
rlo ← rlo >>> 62        the low word's contribution
rhi ← rhi <<< 2         the high word's, since B64 = 4 · B62
dst ← rlo + rhi
```

## Why the three tail instructions do not truncate

Every operation here is `mod 2^64`, so a shift or an add can silently wrap.
Three separate facts rule that out, and each needs the operand bound
`s ra ≤ B62`, `s rb ≤ B62` that `TrigFixed.cosTerm_le` / `sinTerm_le` supply:

* `lo >>> 62 = lo / B62 < 4`, because `lo` is a `u64`;
* `hi <<< 2 = 4 · hi`, because `B64 · hi ≤ a · b ≤ B62²` forces `hi ≤ 2^60`;
* the sum is `a · b / B62 ≤ B62`, so it too stays inside a word.

Without the operand bounds the middle one genuinely fails — `mul62` of two
near-`2^64` values is about `2^66` — so this is not bookkeeping, it is the
reason the recurrence has to contract.

/-! ### The cosine loop body

One iteration of the recurrence, at concrete registers so that every
disjointness side condition is `decide`-able rather than a hypothesis:

```
  1  X          the argument, read-only
  2  t          the running term  (in and out)
  3  4          widening lo / hi
  5  6          the two multiply results
  7  8  9       2k+1, 2k+2, and their product
 10..17         multiplier scratch
```

than stored -- four instructions, against a table the fragment's array model
would otherwise have to carry. -/

The series is alternating, but `Nat` has no signs and the fragment has no
branches, so the two parities are accumulated into separate registers and the
subtraction is left to the consumer (where `ℝ` exists and signs are free).
`MathExtras.TrigTransport.cos_series_dist_le` is stated against exactly that
pair, so nothing is lost.

Selection is by `idx &&& 1` multiplied in, which is why the block divides into
no cases at run time and needs none in its proof beyond the parity split.

`Verified/FoldBridge.lean` folds a program's body into a `Nat`-level fold
*without ever unfolding the body* — which is what makes the wrapper feasible;
threading `denoteInstrs` through the fold by hand blows the kernel up on 53
instructions.  What the bridge wants is an observation of the register file, a
`g` advancing it, and an invariant closed under the step. -/

/-! ### What remains

`cosProgram` is defined, its initialisation is proved, and `cosStepG_defined`
shows the body never faults -- the only partial operation is the `udiv`, whose
divisor `cFactorG_spec` pins as `(2k+1)(2k+2) > 0`.  The end-to-end
`Program.denote` is *not* proved here.

Threading `denoteInstrs_eq_srun` through `(List.range n).foldlM` by hand hits a
kernel "deep recursion detected" -- with an unlimited stack, so it is genuine
term blowup rather than a stack setting -- because the 53-instruction body
unfolds inside the fold.  `Verified/Rolled.lean` and `Verified/FoldBridge.lean`
exist for exactly this and keep the body opaque; the wrapper should go through
them rather than re-deriving the fold. -/
