# One candidate of the `GFoldCheck` round, in closed form

Layer three of the port: the flat `gfRound` fold re-blocks per candidate, and
one candidate's block is described in closed form — the factorisation
registers end at the trial-division block of
`Ports/TrialDivisionBlockSpec.lean`, the accumulator gains the candidate's
ceiling term once, at round `tdiv`, and the pass flag is the disjunction of
the per-exponent checks over the reference mantissa recursion `mantX`.

The consumer-facing reference objects (`gfTerm`, `gfAcc`, `mantX`, `hitAt`,
`candPass`) are all plain `Nat`/`Bool`; the number-theoretic identification
of `tdbBlock` with `Nat.totient` belongs to the consumer, which has Mathlib.

## What is proved

* `round_trial` / `round_exp0` / `round_expS` — one `gfRound`, in closed form,
  in each of the three regimes a block has (`q = 0 … tdiv − 1`, `q = tdiv`,
  `q > tdiv`).
* `trial_fold` / `exp_fold` — the two phases of a block, by induction on the
  round.
* `block_eq_candidate` — **one block is one candidate**: the accumulator gains
  `gfTerm (tdiv + 1) n` exactly once, the mantissa registers end at
  `mantX n (bmax − 1)`, and the pass flag is `orFold`, the disjunction of the
  `bmax` per-exponent checks against the *updated* accumulator.
* `bAcc_eq` — below the running cap `ACAP` the block's `% M` is a no-op, so the
  accumulator is the exact `Nat` sum.
* `rows_of_denote` — **acceptance yields every candidate's check**: if the
  emitted program denotes `1`, then for every candidate `j < len` the exact
  accumulator `gfAcc c j` is under the cap and `candPass` holds at it.  The
  good flag is only ever multiplied by a `0/1`, so a `1` at the end forces a
  `1` at every block; the cap bound comes from the `capOK` bit that a firing
  check re-tests.

Nothing here evaluates a fold, nothing here is a certificate, and nothing
here adds an axiom.
