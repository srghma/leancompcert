# The fixed-point exponential as a program of the proved fragment

`Verified/ExpFixed.lean` proves the mathematics: `expFix P S a` and
`expFixHi P S a` bracket `2 ^ (a / 2^S)` at mantissa precision `P` with a width
of exactly `S` units in the last place, and `rpow_bracket` composes that with
`LogFixed` to bracket `n ^ (Y / 2^T)`.  This module is the other half — the
same computation as an `ArrayBridge.AProgram`, so that `AProgram.evalCC_compile`
applies and the emitted C provably computes what the register machine denotes.

## The round is `7·(P+1) + 16` instructions and carries no division

A round is: take the next bit of the exponent, form the radicand, take its
integer square root, and certify the root.

| step | instructions |
| --- | --- |
| next exponent bit, and shift the exponent down | 2 (`band`, `lshr`) |
| radicand `Z = x · 2^P · 2^b` | 2 (`shl` by a literal, `shl` by a *register*) |
| initialise the root loop | 2 (`mov`, `mov`) |
| `P+1` restoring-square-root iterations | `7·(P+1)` |
| certify the root: `v² ≤ Z < (v+1)²`, and count the two ways it can fail apart | 10 |

At `P = 30` that is `233` instructions and **no division of any width**, so a
round costs the same on every architecture CompCert targets.  `lshr`/`shl` by a
*register* is what makes the `2^b` factor branch-free; `b` is `0` or `1` by
construction.

## Why the square root is computed one way and trusted another

The root is produced by the classical restoring (digit-recurrence) square root,
unrolled at emit time so that the radix-4 digit `4^j` is a literal in every
iteration and the initial normalisation disappears:

```
res ← 0;   for j = P … 0:
    t ← res + 4^j;   c ← [n ≥ t];   n ← n − c·t;   res ← (res + c·2^(2j+1)) >>> 1
```

**Nothing about that iteration is proved.**  It does not have to be: the round
then computes `v·v` and `(v+1)·(v+1)` and compares them against the radicand,
which is exactly `ExpFixed.expOK`'s check, and `ExpFixed.expOK_sound` says a run
whose checks all pass *is* `expIter` — hence `expFix_bracket` applies to it.  A
failed check increments the violation register, which is the program's output,
so an artifact that returns `0` has certified every one of its `S` roots.  This
is the same discipline as `DyadicBisect.sqrtOK`: soundness rests on the check,
the iteration is free to be anything.

## Range of validity

`ExpFixed.expIter_fits_64` proves the two word-size bounds this program needs at
`P ≤ 30`: the radicand `x · 2^b · 2^P` and the successor square `(v+1)²` are
both below `2^63`.  `expCfg_fits` below restates them for the emitted
configuration.  `P = 31` is the wall — there the radicand still fits in 64 bits
but `(v+1)²` can be exactly `2^64`, and the certifying comparison would wrap.

## What is proved here

`expProgram_wf` and `expProgram_compiled` are the fragment obligations; the
`Check` block evaluates the program in the kernel and compares it against
`expFrac`, which is the function `ExpFixed` brackets.  Nothing here re-proves
the mathematics — that is `expFix_bracket` and `rpow_bracket`.

/-! ### The two failure classes, counted apart

`rViol` is the aggregate and stays the program's output, so `denote` means
exactly what it meant before.  But `ExpFixed.expOK`'s two comparisons fail for
opposite reasons and a reader who is told only their sum cannot act on it:

* `rVHi` counts `v·v > Z` — the digit recurrence returned a root that is **too
  large**, so the mantissa is above `⌊√Z⌋` and the bracket's *upper* end is the
  one that moved;
* `rVLo` counts `Z ≥ (v+1)·(v+1)` — the root is **too small**, and it is the
  lower end that moved.

They cannot both fire on one round (`v·v ≤ Z < (v+1)²` is a partition), so the
two counters are disjoint and sum to `rViol`; the driver checks that they do.

rounds and every later round recomputes the mantissa `2^P`, but the body is
branch-free and its instruction count is data-independent, so the cost per
round is unchanged. -/

/-! ## Kernel checks: the program is the function `ExpFixed` brackets

`denote` is `Nat` arithmetic mod `2⁶⁴`.  `expFrac` itself does *not* reduce in
the kernel — it is written with `Nat.sqrt`, which is well-founded — so the
values compared against here are the ones `Verified/ExpFixed.lean`'s `Check`
block certifies for `expFrac` by `expOK_sound`, and the two blocks together say
the digit recurrence and `Nat.sqrt` agree.  These check that the `233`
instructions implement it — at the exponent `0` where every round is
the identity, at `1/2` and `1/4` where a single bit fires, and at the
fractional part of `log₂ 3` where every round fires.  In each case the
violation register is `0`, so every root passed `ExpFixed.expOK`'s two
comparisons.
