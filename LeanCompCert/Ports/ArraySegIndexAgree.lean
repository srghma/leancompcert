# Index agreement for the segmented sieve's core body

Two run shapes appear in the segmented Möbius port and they disagree about the
loop index:

* `bodyRun idx c fuel s` iterates `arun idx` — the index is **fixed**, and it
  is what `readSig_windowRun_main_cell_eq_rootFoldValue` is stated against;
* `indexedBodyRun idx c fuel s` iterates `arun (idx + k)` — the index
  **advances**, and it is what `combinedSignals` reduces to.

Nothing composes the two, which is why the emitted-cell theorem cannot be fed
to the signal schedule directly.

They do agree, but not unconditionally: `Cfg.coreBody` reads `.idx` in exactly
two instructions, and both are phase selectors —

```
reg 130 ← idx < rootSpan        (in the root phase?)
reg 142 ← idx = rootSpan − 1     (the last root step?)
```

so any two indices that are **past the root span** and are **not the last root
step** drive the body identically.  Those are precisely the hypotheses
`hmain` and `hidxNe` that the emitted-cell theorem already carries, so the
agreement costs its consumer nothing.

⚠ The bound `i < M` is load-bearing on both sides: `.idx` denotes `idx % M`, so
without it two indices congruent mod `2^64` would compare equal to `rootSpan`
when only one of them is.

The general machinery — `ainstrIndexFree`, `astep_indexFree` — is
`CDEMAbelIndexIndependence`'s and is not sieve-specific.  What is specific is
the *pointwise* variant below: `arun_indexFree` needs the whole block index
free, and this block is not.

/-- **The main phase's emitted signals are the mathematical schedule.**

The root phase (`combinedSignals_root_schedule`) and the marking phase
(`combinedSignals_main_mark_schedule`) are already known idle; this is the
third and last one, and the only one that carries information.

`hcell` is the emitted-cell equation — `readSig_windowRun_main_cell_eq_rootFoldValue`'s
conclusion — taken as a hypothesis rather than restated with its twenty-one
side conditions about table, budget and cursor.  Everything between it and the
schedule is the index bookkeeping proved above.

★ `fuel` is a parameter rather than `c.segLen`: a *partial* window is what
event-level coverage needs, since an interpreted event generally sits inside a
segment rather than at its end. -/
