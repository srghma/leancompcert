# One sieve, many row tests

`MertensCDEM` proves a complete trial-division sweep and then, in its last
250 lines, turns the flat fold over `[0, len·rounds)` into one flag per
candidate.  That section is written against `RowFail` and `moOf`, so a sweep
that keeps a *different* accumulator or applies a *different* test cannot use
any of it — as the Hurst port discovered, at a cost of about 150 lines of
near-identical transcription.

This module is that section with the two varying pieces abstracted:

* `P : Nat → Nat → Bool` — the row **failure** test, applied to `(X, acc)`;
  `true` means the row is a violation, matching `MertensCDEM.RowFail`.  `Bool`
  rather than a decidable `Prop` so that instantiating never has to match
  `Decidable` instances structurally; see `gstep_eq_gstepB` for what that
  costs and does not cost.
* `acc : Nat → Nat → Trial → Nat` — the accumulator's advance, gated by the
  last-round flag.

Nothing else varies.  `gA` and `gB` — the candidate reset and the trial
division — are CDEM's, because that is the sieve being shared.

## What an instantiation owes

Two facts, both about `acc` alone and both one line in practice:

* `acc_zero` — a round that is not the last leaves the accumulator alone.
  This is what lets a block collapse to a single advance.
* `acc_lt` — the accumulator stays a word.

## What it gets

`valueB_eq_zero_sound` : if the program's fold is `0` then no candidate in
`[lo, lo + len)` fails `P`.  From there a port needs only to say
what `P` and `acc` *mean*, which is the mathematics and not the machine.

**The certificate's meaning, abstractly.**

If the fold is `0` then every candidate of the shard passes the row test,
against the accumulator's value at that candidate.  A port instantiating this
owes only the *meaning* of `P` and `accAt` — no machine, no trace and no
problem size appears here.

/-! ### The abstraction is faithful

An abstraction that no real port instantiates is worse than none, so CDEM's
own step is checked against it here.

⚠ It is *not* `rfl`, as first written: `if (b : Bool) then _ else _` carries
the instance `instDecidableEqBool (decide Q) true`, while the concrete step
carries `Or.decidable`.  The two agree only after `decide_eq_true_eq`.  That
is a one-simp gap, not a design problem — but it is the reason a port cannot
simply *define* its step as `gstepB` and expect its existing `rfl` proofs to
survive. -/
