# Hurst's test, as an instruction block

The reduction on the `claude_math` side leaves

```text
1000² · M(n)²  ≤  571² · n
```

and a scan has to decide that at every `n`.  Three things stop it being a
comparison of two registers.

* `M(n)` is **signed** and the machine is not.  The scan carries it as a pair
  of non-negative counts, and `absDiffG` recovers `|M(n)|` branchlessly.
* Squaring leaves the word: at `n = 10^16`, `|M(n)| ≈ 10^8`, so the left side
  is about `10^22` against `2^64 ≈ 1.8·10^19`.
* Once both sides are 128-bit, the comparison itself is `le128G`.

The one arrangement that matters: `1000² · D²` is computed as `(1000·D)²`,
not as `1000² · D²`.  Folding the constant in *before* the widening multiply
keeps the only single-word product at `1000·D ≈ 10^11`, comfortably inside a
word, and leaves exactly one widening step per side.  The other grouping
overflows before the widening can help.

Registers are concrete so every disjointness condition is `decide`-able:

```
 30 31   the two accumulator counts (in)
 32      n (in)
 33      |M(n)|
 34      1000·|M(n)|
 35 36   left  limbs
 37 38   right limbs
 39      the constant 571² = 326041
 40      verdict (out)

/-! ### The accumulator

The sieve's signal already carries what the accumulator needs.  `muSig` is
`⟨n, [μ(n) = 1], [μ(n) = −1], 1⟩`, and `readSig` reads those from registers
`65, 79, 80, 133`.  So the two indicator bits are sitting in `79` and `80`,
and the update is two adds — no decoding, no comparison, no branch.

That is also why the accumulator is a *pair* of counts rather than a signed
value: the signal is already split by sign, so keeping it split costs nothing
and avoids representing negatives in a machine that has none. -/

Accumulate, then test — in that order, so the verdict is about the counters
*after* this point is folded in.  This is the whole non-sieve half of the
body; composing it with the emitted sieve is separate and larger, since
`readSig_windowRun_main_cell_eq_rootFoldValue` carries twenty-one hypotheses
about the table, the budget and the cursor. -/

The sieve lives in the array machine and the body above is scalar, so the
body has to be lifted.  `arun_lift` makes that free *and* records the fact
the composition actually needs: a lifted block leaves `arr` alone.  That is
what lets the accumulator run after the sieve without disturbing the table
the sieve is still using. -/

/-! ### The row test as a drop-in for `MertensCDEM.bodyC2b`

`Ports/MertensCDEM.lean` is a complete, both-arrows-proved Mertens sieve, and
its stage `bodyC2a` already leaves `|M(X)|` in register 37 with the candidate
`X` in register 9.  Its `bodyC2b` then tests the *linear* Cohen–Dress–El
Marraki row inequality `den·|M| + slack ≤ X`.

Hurst differs only in the shape of that test — `(1000·|M|)² ≤ 571²·X` — so the
whole sieve, the biased accumulator and the sharding are reusable and only the
row test changes.  `hurstRowG` is that replacement, on registers 60+ so it
cannot collide with the 0–53 the existing body uses.

Note this needs no `absDiffG`: the biased accumulator has already produced
`|M|` branchlessly, which is a better arrangement than carrying two counts. -/

/-! ### The model-level row predicate

`MertensCDEM` carries a `cap` field and an `Admissible.capSound` conjunct
because its comparison `den·|M| + slack ≤ X` must fit a word, so `|M|` has to
be clamped first.

The widening comparison removes *half* of that need and no more.  The
comparison itself is between limb pairs and cannot overflow whatever `|M|` is
— but the row test first forms `1000·|M|` in a **single** word, and that
product overflows for large `|M|` exactly as CDEM's does.  So Hurst needs the
clamp too, and needs the same soundness argument for it.

⚠ The earlier claim here — that the widening comparison made the clamp
unnecessary — was wrong, and wrong in the dangerous direction: it left
`1000 * s 37 < M` as an unmet hypothesis on the row spec, which no caller
could have discharged.  `hurstCap_engaged_fails` below is the `capSound`
analogue that makes clamping conservative: if the clamp engages at all, the
row is reported as failing, so a run that reports no violation proves the
clamp never engaged. -/

/-! ### The substituted body

`MertensCDEM.body = bodyA ++ bodyB ++ bodyC1 ++ bodyC2a ++ bodyC2b`.  Only the
last stage is Hurst-specific, so the substituted body reuses the first four
verbatim and replaces `bodyC2b` with the widening test followed by the same
violation-flag algebra.

The flag algebra is copied rather than shared because CDEM's version computes
its row bit through the `cap` clamp; here the bit is `1 − reg 66` directly.
Registers 60–77 are used by the test, so the program needs `regCount = 78`
rather than CDEM's 54. -/

replaces exactly that, and `gA`/`gB` are reused unchanged.

`|M|` this file talks about and the one `MertensCDEM.bodyC2a` produces are the

The fold's observation is `⟨bad, mo, trial⟩` = registers `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.  The
substituted stage writes only the violation flag among those, so registers
1–4 are untouched — which is half of what `hurstBody_obs` has to say, and the
half that needs no arithmetic.

The destination registers of `hurstTestFlagG` do not depend on the `Cfg` (only
its literals do), so this is a frame fact about the code shape alone. -/

/-! ### The flag algebra

Simpler than `MertensCDEM`'s: there is no `cap`, so no case split on whether
the clamp bites and no lemma that a clamped comparison stays inside a word.

The verdict has to be resolved into an explicitly-typed `have` **before** any
`simp` touches the goal — `rw ... at *` fails here, because the verdict's `if`
sits under a binder in the unfolded `srun` chain and the motive does not
typecheck. -/

/-! ### The prefix, in the fold's own terms

`MertensCDEM.body_obs` derives everything below inside its own proof and
exposes none of it, so the four shared stages have to be re-derived here.
Stating them once as `hurstPrefix_spec` is what keeps the substituted body's
observation short — and it says exactly what the substitution needs: where the
candidate, the last-round flag, the updated accumulator and `|M|` live when
the fifth stage begins. -/

/-! ### The observation equation

With the prefix packaged, the substituted body's observation is the
composition of two facts and nothing else: the prefix puts the candidate, the
last-round flag, the updated accumulator and `|M|` where the fifth stage
expects them, and the fifth stage's flag algebra is `hurstBadOf`.

`hurstCapAdmissible` is the extra config obligation the clamp introduces —
two inequalities, both about `Cfg` alone. -/

/-! ## The program

`MertensCDEM`'s init block, entry state and invariant are reused unchanged —
the substitution touches only the fifth body stage, and the loop's shape is
identical.  `regCount` widens from 54 to 78 for the test's registers, which is
why `Instr.WF_mono` is needed: CDEM's stages are proved well-formed at 54.

/-! ## From the flat index space to candidates

`MertensCDEM`'s block section is written against `RowFail`, so it does not
apply to a substituted predicate.  What *is* shared is everything the
predicate does not touch: `moAdvance`, `moAt`, `trialRun`, `trialPrefix` and
the accumulator's exact recurrence (`moAt_succ`, `moAt_bounds`).  The Hurst
copies below track only the violation flag, which is the one component that
differs.

★ Worth stating plainly: `hurstGstep` and `gstep` produce *identical* `mo` and
`t` at every index (`hurstGstep_mo_eq`, `hurstGstep_t_eq`, both `rfl`).  The
accumulator this file reasons about is therefore literally CDEM's, and every
theorem CDEM proves about `moAt` is available unchanged. -/

**The certificate's meaning.**

If the program denotes `0` then, at every candidate of the shard, the biased
running value satisfies Hurst's inequality in its exact integer form

    (1000·|M(X)|)² ≤ 326041·X            i.e.  |M(X)| ≤ 0.571·√X

and the anchor holds.  `moAt` is still the *program's* running value;
identifying `absOf c (moAt c (n+1))` with `|Σ_{k ≤ X} μ(k)|` is the consumer's
obligation, and `MathExtras.SieveProgramBridge` is what discharges it.

The clamp is invisible in the conclusion: `hurstAbsClamped_eq` shows a passing
row was compared against the true `|M(X)|`.

/-! ## Kernel sanity checks

The denotation is proved by simulation, so these evaluate nothing the proof
depends on; they exist to catch a mis-transcribed instruction.  `M(8) = −2`,
so the biased running value at `X = 8` is `98`.

The third check is the one that matters for this port: with the row test
switched **on** from `X = 1`, the sweep must reject, because Hurst's bound
`|M(x)| ≤ 0.571√x` is false at small `x` — `|M(1)| = 1` and
`0.571·√1 < 1`.  A test that silently passed here would be one that never
looked at the row.
