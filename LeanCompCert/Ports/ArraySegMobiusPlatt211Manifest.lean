# Kernel-checked structure of the completed Platt (2.11) manifest

This file checks the cheap but load-bearing part of the retained production
receipt: every window is nonempty and internally consistent, indices and
ranges are gap-free, the next accumulator seed is exactly the preceding
output, the chain begins at one and ends at `10^12`, and the only nonzero
artifact counter is the documented inherited equality at row one (`n = 2`).

It intentionally does not claim that a JSON file proves a CompCert run.  The
physical run admissions and the source-sieve refinement are separate layers.
