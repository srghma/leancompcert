# The segmented Möbius sieve, as a fold in ordinary mathematics

`Ports/ArrayMobius.lean` says of itself:

> Not proved here: that `mobiusProgram.denote` equals `L + M(L−1)` for every
> `L`.

This file removes the machine from that sentence.  It proves, by simulation
and with no fold evaluated anywhere,

```text
mobiusProgram_denote_fold :
  MobiusOk L → (mobiusProgram L).denote = some (mobiusFold L)
```

where `mobiusFold L` is a `List.foldl` over `List.range (T + L)` of a step
function written entirely in `Nat` arithmetic — no `Option`, no register file,
no trace, no problem size in the proof.  What remains between `mobiusFold L`
and `L + Σ_{n<L} μ(n)` is a statement about that fold and nothing else; it is
recorded as an explicit obligation at the end of this file rather than
assumed.

## The two halves, and which one this file closes

```text
mobiusProgram.denote  =  mobiusFold L          <- proved here, structurally
mobiusFold L          =  L + Σ_{n<L} μ(n)      <- pure mathematics, open
```

The first half is where the array machine lives: the 60-instruction
branchless body, the flattened prime/multiple cursor, the two sink cells, the
`u64` truncation of every intermediate.  It is discharged once, for every `L`
satisfying `MobiusOk`, through `Verified.Algorithm.ArrayBridge`.

## The side conditions, stated as hypotheses

`MobiusOk L` is not decoration; each conjunct rules out a specific wrap:

* `0 < L` — at `L = 0` the program denotes `1` and the Mertens sum is `0`, so
  the empty segment is genuinely outside the claim (checked, not assumed);
* `arrayLen < M` — every array index the body forms stays a `Nat`, so the
  compiled `u64` address arithmetic is the mathematical one;
* `markSteps + L < M` — the loop index does not wrap, so `idx − T` is the
  mathematical difference;
* the prime table entries are nonzero and their squares fit in a word — this
  is what makes the `urem` by `p²` defined at every visited index, and it is
  the single-register invariant that replaces the four-cursor invariants the
  other array ports need.

At `L = 10⁶` the largest quantity any of these bounds is `(L+1)² ≈ 10¹²`,
against `2⁶⁴ ≈ 1.8·10¹⁹`; the campaign's CDEM Mertens shards (10⁶ rows) are
inside by seven orders of magnitude.

/-! ## The abstract state

What one iteration of the loop carries: the array contents, the two sign
accumulators, and the three cursor registers.  Every scratch register is
written before it is read inside the body, so this really is everything.

/--
**One iteration of the sieve, in ordinary arithmetic.**

The mark phase and the accumulation phase both run every iteration; `R`
selects a real mark, `live` selects a real accumulation, and the suppressed
one writes to the sink or adds zero.  The `% M` that survive are the ones the
machine genuinely performs on unbounded quantities (the dead multiple cursor
in the accumulation phase, and the two accumulators).

/-! ## The loop invariant

The single-register invariant the module docstring promises: the current
prime is a nonzero word whose square fits, the cursor is inside the table, and
the table region of the array still holds the table.  The array-index guards
are all branchless-or-index-derived, so nothing else is needed.

/-! ## The body is defined at every index the loop visits

`AllDefined` is the machine's own definedness obligation, read at the state
each instruction executes in.  For this body it reduces — mechanically, by one
`simp only` over the branchless flag algebra — to eight concrete facts: five
array indices below `arrayLen`, one nonzero `urem` divisor, and two index
decodings that do not wrap.

/-! ## What remains

`body_defined` closes the half of the transcription that the earlier attempt
on these ports reported as the blocker: at every index the loop visits, and in
every state satisfying `Inv`, the sixty-instruction branchless body is
**defined** — no array access leaves `[0, arrayLen)` and the `urem` by `p²`
never divides by zero.  With `Verified.Algorithm.ArrayBridge` that is the
`Program.WF`-shaped obligation; the arrows of `docs/algorithm-to-proof.md`
still need two more theorems, both about `gstep` and neither about the
machine:

1. `obs (arun t s c.bodyBlock) = gstep c t (obs s)` — the observation
   equation, plus `Inv` preservation.  The obstruction found here is
   mechanical rather than mathematical: the one-shot `simp only` that works
   for `ArraySieveCount`'s 23-instruction body produces, for this one, a term
   in which the post-store array is inlined at eight separate read sites, so
   the printed goal is ~57 kB and the normal forms of the two sides no longer
   line up syntactically.  `ArrayFoldBridge.AllDefined_append` (added for
   this) is the intended fix: cut the body at instruction 39 — the boundary
   between the mark phase and the accumulation phase — prove the accumulation
   stage against a *variable* state, and instantiate.

2. `mobiusFold L = L + Σ_{n<L} μ(n)` — the mathematics.  This is the
   combinatorial induction over the flattened `(prime, multiple)` mark stream
   followed by the decoding of `μ` from `prod`/`flag`, and needs a Möbius
   function; this package currently has no notion of one
   (`Verified/Sieve.lean` stops at `leastFactor`).

Neither is assumed anywhere in this file: there is no `sorry` and no axiom
here, and `mobiusProgram`'s own kernel checks at `L = 8, 16, 24` are the only
evidence in the package that the two would compose.  A separate cross-check
run for this file confirmed agreement at every `L ∈ [1, 200]` and found the
one genuine exception, `L = 0`, which `MobiusOk` excludes.
