# The §4.1.3 `g₂` sweep: the transparent model with a clean flag

`Ports/Section413G2Program.lean` states two open obligations.  This file
attacks the second,

```text
(2)  c.tFlag = 0 → g2SweepOK c.rounds c.checkLo c.cap = true
                                                [model ⇒ reference model]
```

the direction in which the machine's *runtime width guards* pay for
themselves: with the violation flag still `0` at the end of the run, no
`u64` quantity the sweep computed was ever truncated, so every word is
`Section413Cells.encodeZ` of the exact `Int` the reference model
(`Ports/Section413Sweep.lean`) computes, and the wrapped machine arithmetic
transfers to `Int` arithmetic term by term.

## The architecture

1. **The flag is monotone.**  `viol` is only ever `|||`-ed, never cleared,
   by any block of the transparent model.  Hence `tFlag = 0` propagates
   *backwards* to every prefix of the run (`tRunUpto_viol_zero_of_le`),
   which is what lets the main induction run *forwards* under a hypothesis
   about the end of the run.  This is the (C.17) `accCap` discipline.
2. **A clean guard is a width bound.**  `tguard` ORs `1` exactly when the
   encoded word leaves `[−CAP, CAP]`, so a clean guard on a live gate is
   the statement `|decodeZ w| ≤ CAP` (`capped_iff_guard_clean`) — from
   which `decodeZ`/`encodeZ` round-trip and no `% M` truncated anything.
3. **Cell transfer.**  Under those width bounds the word-level blocks
   compute the reference model's cell operations: `tmag` is sign and
   `natAbs`, `tlt` is the signed order of 128-bit sign-magnitude triples,
   and `tcmul` is `Section413Sweep.cmul` of the decoded cells — the last
   of these, `tcmul_spec`, is the heaviest single block of the program
   (378 of its instructions, three uses per iteration).  The wrapped
   `+`, `2·` and `0−` of the surrounding blocks transfer likewise.
4. **Phase 1, phase 2, the run.**  `sweep_prefix` relates every candidate
   boundary to `g2Prefix`; `tFlag_zero_sound` reads the final Boolean.

Nothing below is an axiom, a `sorry`, a `native_decide`, or a weakened
restatement of an obligation.  Everything is
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-! ## §11 The rounding half: an exact `10¹⁸` division with the rounding

`divP18Body` produces the floor and the ceiling of the *magnitude*; the
model's outward rounding then selects one of them, and negates, according
to the sign bit — exactly the four `Section413Cells` bridges

/-! A note on tactic discipline in what follows.  `tsub` and `tdiv18` are
`% 2⁶⁴`-saturated definitions whose bodies the kernel will happily try to
*evaluate*: any tactic that forces a `whnf` through one of them (a `show`
across an `ite`, say) sends the kernel into the five-digit long division
and it reports "deep recursion".  Every `ite` below is therefore taken
apart by a **syntactic** `rw [ite_eq_left …]` / `rw [ite_eq_right …]`, never by
reduction, and `tdiv18` is rewritten away by `tdiv18_of_Rep` before
anything else touches it. -/

/-! ## §14 Encoded arithmetic transfers

The wrapped `u64` operations of the transparent model are the reference
model's `Int` operations on the decoded endpoints.  Unconditionally the
machine computes `encodeZ` of the right value; the *capped* forms below add
that no wrap occurred, so `decodeZ` reads it back — that is exactly what
the runtime guards buy, since two capped endpoints sum to at most
`2·CAP = 2⁶¹`, comfortably inside the signed range `2⁶³`. -/

/-! ## §16 A legacy global guard invariant

These definitions record the first proof route considered for obligation
(2).  They remain useful descriptions of the initial state, but they are not
the invariant used by the soundness proof: accumulator-plane stores are not
guarded immediately, so `ArrCapped` is not preserved after every `tstep`.

The selected route instead obtains bounds exactly where the machine checks
them.  `ttouch_clean_parts` and `ttouch_live_caps` extract the local guards;
`tcmul_decode`, `ttouch_live_term_decode`, `ttouch_live_delta_decode`, and
`ttouchStore_decode` then transfer one live touch without asserting a global
cap on every accumulator slot. -/

`passB_full` proves the scheduled divisor fold, `final_step_spec` proves the
active finalizer and wide `g2Check`, and `sweep_prefix` carries their joint
invariant from the phase-1 zero state through all `cap` candidates.
`tFlag_zero_sound` is the resulting model-to-reference theorem.  The separate
module `Section413G2Verified` joins it to `g2Program_denote` and the verified
compiler theorem without introducing an import cycle.
