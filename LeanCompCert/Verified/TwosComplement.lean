# Two's complement, for the accumulator

Sign-magnitude is the right representation for the *multiply* — the sign is an
`xor` and the magnitude is an unsigned product, and `SignedFixedMul` proves it.
It is the wrong representation for the *accumulator*.

⚠ Sign-magnitude addition needs a comparison, two subtractions, and a
branchless select: about nineteen instructions.  Two's complement addition is
`.add`, and the machine's `.add` is already modulo `2⁶⁴`, which **is** two's
complement addition.  One instruction.

★ So the evaluator should use both: sign-magnitude across the multiply,
two's complement across the sum, with a conversion at the boundary.  That is
what real implementations do, and it is not an optimisation detail — nineteen
instructions per term against one, over `M ≈ 7·10⁵` terms per sample, is the
difference between a feasible run and an infeasible one.

## What is proved

* `tcVal` — the value a register denotes, read as signed;
* `tcAdd_val` — `.add` is exact, **given the sum stays in range**;
* `tcOfSign_val` — the conversion from sign-magnitude agrees.

⚠ `tcAdd_val`'s range hypothesis is the real obligation, and it is on the
*result*, not the inputs.  Two in-range summands can leave the range: at
`S = 62` the accumulator holds a sum of `M` terms and the caller must bound it.
That is exactly the headroom the fixed-point scale has to buy.

/-- **`.add` is two's complement addition.**

The hypotheses say the two operands are register values and the *result* is in
signed range; the conclusion is that the machine's modular add is exact.

⚠ The range condition is on the **result**.  Two in-range summands can leave
the range, and then the modular add is simply not the signed sum. -/

/-- **`.sub` is two's complement subtraction.**

The machine's `.sub a b` is `(a + (M - b)) % M`, and that is the signed
difference whenever the result is in range.

⚠ Note the encoding handles `b = 0` by wrapping: `(a + M) % M = a`, not
`a + M`.  Without that the block would need a special case. -/
