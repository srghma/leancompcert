# Statically-sized arbitrary-precision arithmetic (limb layer)

The goldbach certificate corpus needs integers far beyond 64 bits
(fixed-point scales at `2⁶⁴`, intermediates near `2⁹⁷`, dyadic interval
mantissas, and — at the extreme — 143-kbit rational seeds), but never
*unbounded* precision: every width is statically known per certificate. So
"arbitrary arithmetic" means statically-sized limb vectors, and this module
provides the mathematical core: little-endian `u64` limb vectors with
machine-checked value-denotation theorems for ripple carry and borrow.

Each limb operation is per-limb `u64` arithmetic with a carry chain —
exactly the pattern already proved and compiled at two limbs by the wide
Mertens certificate (carry = proved `<` comparison widened by a proved
cast) — so every operation here realizes in the reflection DSL as a
fixed-shape instruction block whose `denote` computes these functions, and
`Program.evalCC_compile` transports correctness to the CCIR and C models.

Comparison falls out of subtraction: `xs < ys` is the borrow bit of
`sbb xs ys 0` (`lt_iff`). Multiplication (schoolbook over 32-bit
half-limbs), dyadic scaling (shifts), and outward-rounded division (Newton
reciprocal, with interval rounding absorbing the approximation) are
`O(limbs²)` compositions of these primitives over the same value
denotation.
