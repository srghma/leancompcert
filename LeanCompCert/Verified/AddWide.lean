# The two-limb accumulator, and its carry

`Verified/MulWide.lean` gives the 64×64→128 *product* as a limb pair.  What it
does not give — and what the `ψ` residue needs — is a two-limb **add with
carry**, because the accumulator `Σ lnFix(p) − 2^S·n` does not fit in one
64-bit word.

## Why one word is not enough

The residual form is forced: the direct form `2^S·ψ(n)` reaches `2^S·10¹³` and
caps `S` at `20`.  In residual form the reduced family itself bounds the
accumulator by `2^S·√2·√n = 2^S·4.472·10⁶`, so a single `u64` allows `S ≤ 40`
(at `S = 41` the bound is `9.83·10¹⁸ > 2⁶³`).  At `S = 40` the enclosure the
`logFold` bracket carries — `4` ulps per term over `π*(10¹³) = 346 065 765 710`
terms — is `1.259` absolute, i.e. `3.98·10⁻⁷` in the ratio the family prints to
eight decimals.  The margin behind `0.79059276` is at most `10⁻⁸`, which needs
`2^S ≥ 4.377·10¹³`, i.e. `S ≥ 45.32`.  One word is short by a factor of `40`.

At `S = 48` the accumulator is 71 bits: two words and a carry.

## The carry is a proved comparison, not a flag

The fragment has no carry flag and no branches.  For `u, v < 2⁶⁴` the truncated
sum `(u + v) mod 2⁶⁴` is below `v` exactly when the untruncated sum overflowed,
so `if lo < v then 1 else 0` **is** the carry bit (`carry_bit`).  That is the
same trick `MulWide.step` uses, isolated here and proved once.

Four fragment instructions realize a full two-limb add:

```
  lo ← lo + a.lo          -- add
  c  ← lo < a.lo          -- lt   (a.lo is still the old value)
  hi ← hi + a.hi          -- add
  hi ← hi + c             -- add
```

and three realize the one-word specializations `addWideLo` / `subWideLo`,
which is what the accumulator loop actually uses (`+ lnFix(p)` once per prime
power, `− 2^S·gap` once per test point).

## What is proved

`addWide_spec` and `subWide_spec` are the machine statements: the limb pair
recombines to the exact `mod 2¹²⁸` result, mirroring `denoteOp` at both limbs.
`addWide_exact` and `subWide_exact` are the no-wrap corollaries the accumulation
theorem uses, and `sumWide_spec` runs the fold: a list of `u64` values whose
sum is below `2¹²⁸` accumulates *exactly*, with no hypothesis about how the
individual carries interact.
