# M3 — Fixed-shape gcd equivalent to the reference recursion

`Nat.gcd` recurses by well-founded descent on its first argument, so its
call tree depends on the data — unusable as a machine loop shape. This
module gives the fixed-shape counterpart: a fuel-indexed Euclid loop
whose per-round work is one guarded step (`if a = 0` then hold, else
`(b % a, a)`), suitable for later realization as a counted machine loop.

The step is guarded behind the `a = 0` test on a free variable, matching
the house pattern that keeps the kernel from runaway reduction on bare
big-Nat recursion arguments.

Main results:
* `gcdFuel_eq` — with fuel at least `a`, the fuel loop computes exactly
  `Nat.gcd a b`.
* `gcdFuel_u64` — machine-width corollary: `2 ^ 64` rounds suffice for
  any `a < 2 ^ 64`.
