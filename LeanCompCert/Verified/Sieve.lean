# M5 — Fixed-shape smallest-prime-factor equivalent to the reference recursion

Opening slice of the verified sieve: the smallest-prime-factor computation
in two forms and the equivalence between them.

The reference `leastFactor` climbs candidates from 2 and stops at the first
divisor at most `√n` — a data-dependent trip count, unusable as a machine
loop shape. The fixed-shape form `spfFixed` instead scans *every* candidate
`d ∈ [2, bound + 1]` for a statically chosen `bound`, keeping the first
divisor via an `acc = 0` found-mask, so each round is one guarded select
over a data-independent iteration space — the shape an array-realized sieve
executes per cell.

Both sides are characterized against the common predicate `Hit n d`
(`2 ≤ d ∧ d * d ≤ n ∧ n % d = 0`) as "the least hit, else no hit at all",
and uniqueness of the least element gives the equivalence.

Main results:
* `spfScan_spec` — scan invariant: after `bound` rounds the accumulator is
  0 with every hit beyond the scanned window, or it is the least hit.
* `leastFactorFrom_spec` — reference invariant: with no hit below the
  current candidate and fuel covering the climb, the loop returns `n` with
  no hit existing, or the least hit.
* `spfFixed_eq_leastFactor` — with `n < (bound + 2)²` (the static bound
  covers the square-root window), the fixed-shape scan computes exactly
  the reference smallest prime factor.
