# The accumulator fold, in two's complement

`MainSumFold` bounds a sample of the main sum with a sign-magnitude
accumulator.  The mathematics there is right, but `TwosComplement` shows the
representation is wrong for emission: sign-magnitude addition is nineteen
instructions and `.add` is one.  This is the same fold re-fronted so the proved
object matches the code that will be emitted.

## Three sums, deliberately kept apart

⚠ There are **three** quantities here and collapsing any two of them is the
mistake to avoid:

* `tcSum` — what the machine computes, a `Nat` register value;
* `computedSum` — the exact signed sum of the *computed* terms;
* `exactSum` — the sum of the *exact* terms, which is what is wanted.

`tcSum_val` relates the first two: the accumulation is exact, so the machine
loses nothing.  `sum_error` relates the second two: the terms themselves are
only approximate, and that is where all the error lives.

★ Splitting them is what makes the bound linear.  Because the accumulation
contributes nothing, `M` terms contribute exactly `M` terms' worth of error.

## The obligation that is new

⚠ Sign-magnitude addition can only overflow the register.  Two's complement
addition can silently **wrap into the wrong sign**, which is worse: the result
is a perfectly valid register value.  `PartialsInRange` rules that out, and it
is stated at every suffix — a run of large positive terms followed by large
negative ones has a small total and can still wrap in the middle, so bounding
only the total would be unsound.

/-! ## Checks -/

/-- The empty accumulator is zero. -/
example : tcSum [] = 0 := rfl

/-- ⚠ Wrapping is real, and it is why `PartialsInRange` exists: two positive
in-range terms accumulate to a **negative** register value. -/
example : tcVal (tcSum [(H - 1, 0), (1, 0)]) = -(H : Int) := by decide

/-- And that assignment does *not* satisfy `PartialsInRange`, so `tcSum_val`
never applies to it. -/
example : ¬ (tcVal (H - 1) + computedSum [((1 : Nat), (0 : Int))] < (H : Int)) := by
  decide
