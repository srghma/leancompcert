# Signed fixed-point multiply

`FixedMul.fpMul` is unsigned, and that is not enough for the thing it was built
for: a rotation factor `e^{-iδ log n}` has a cosine and a sine that both take
either sign, so every product in the Riemann–Siegel main sum is signed.

`SignedLimb` supplies signed *addition* in sign-magnitude form but no multiply.
This module adds it, and sign-magnitude turns out to be exactly the right
representation for the job: the sign is an `xor` and the magnitude is `fpMul`,
with no interaction between them.

## ⚠ The rounding direction changes, and that is fine

Truncating a *magnitude* rounds toward **zero**.  Truncating a two's-complement
value rounds toward **−∞**.  These are different operations and give different
answers on negative inputs.

★ Nothing downstream breaks, because the real-side contract
(`MathExtras.FixedPointRotation.IsFPMul`) was deliberately written to say only
*"within one ulp"* and not *which* rounding.  Had it pinned truncation-toward-
−∞, this representation would have been excluded for no reason.  That is the
payoff for leaving the rounding abstract.

## What is proved

`sfpMul_error` — the computed value, rescaled, differs from the exact product
by less than one ulp.  It is stated over `Int` so the sign is explicit rather
than encoded in a modular representative.

⚠ `-0` and `+0` are distinct representations.  That is harmless here — both
denote `0` under `val` — but it means `SFix` is not a normal form and equality
of representations is stronger than equality of values. -/

/-- The arithmetic core, over abstract variables.

⚠ Kept abstract on purpose.  Running `omega` with `2 ^ S` and `B64` in scope
made the kernel recurse too deeply to check the resulting term; with the

the point of use. -/

/-! ## Checks

The sign algebra, at the working scale.  `1.0` is `2^62`. -/

/-- Negative times negative is positive. -/
example : sfpMul 62 ⟨true, 2 ^ 62⟩ ⟨true, 2 ^ 62⟩ = ⟨false, 2 ^ 62⟩ := by rfl

/-- Negative times positive is negative. -/
example : sfpMul 62 ⟨true, 2 ^ 62⟩ ⟨false, 2 ^ 62⟩ = ⟨true, 2 ^ 62⟩ := by rfl

/-- ⚠ Truncation rounds toward **zero**, not toward `-∞`: the negative case
gives magnitude `2^62 - 2`, the same magnitude as the positive case, whereas
a two's-complement shift would have gone the other way. -/
example : sfpMul 62 ⟨true, 2 ^ 62 - 1⟩ ⟨false, 2 ^ 62 - 1⟩
    = ⟨true, 2 ^ 62 - 2⟩ := by rfl
