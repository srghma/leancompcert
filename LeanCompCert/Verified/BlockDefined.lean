# Definedness of a block without putting its constants into the normal form

A straight-line block is defined when each of its `udiv`/`urem` has a nonzero
divisor *at the state that instruction executes in* (`InstrBlock.SAllDefined`).
For a real port body that is a handful of side conditions inside a hundred and
some instructions, and the obvious way to get at them — unfold `SAllDefined`,
`srun`, `sval`, `denoteOp`, `denoteOperand` in one `simp` — does not scale.
It fails in two distinct ways, both measured on `Ports/RamareWM217.lean`:

1. **The state grows a layer per instruction.**  Reading the divisor register
   means peeling one `RegState.set` for every intervening instruction, and
   each peel drags that instruction's arithmetic into the goal even though
   nothing depends on it.
2. **The dragged-in arithmetic contains the program's constants.**  A
   fixed-point ladder carries `2⁴⁸`-scale literals, and `simp` normalising
   `(reg ⊕ literal) % M` unary-unfolds them, because the kernel's `Nat.add`
   and `Nat.mul` recurse on their **second** argument.  Unfolding one such
   block inside `simp` reports `(kernel) deep recursion detected` outright.

Reordering the program's operands would dodge (2), but only by changing the
program — which invalidates any measured run of the emitted C.  The fix has to
be proof-side, and it is a discipline rather than a tactic:

> **Never normalise an instruction you did not ask about.**
>
> * Thread state as `srun k s prefix`, an opaque term — never as a tower of
>   `RegState.set`.  `sAllDefined_stage` is the only way this module lets you
>   advance, and it hands you exactly that form.
> * Retire whole division-free stages with `sAllDefined_of_noDiv`, whose
>   hypothesis is a `Bool` computed from *opcodes only*.
> * Read a divisor with `RegFrame.srun_read_write`, whose side conditions are
>   `Bool`s computed from *register indices only*.
> * Turn the one `denoteOp` you actually care about into a value with the
>   lemmas below, each stated for **variable** operands under a numeric
>   hypothesis.  A literal enters the proof only as the subject of a `<`
>   comparison, where it is one GMP call and no unfolding.
>
> Under this discipline the size of a port's constants is irrelevant to the
> cost of its definedness proof, and no `simp` set ever has to grow.

## What the trigger actually is, and what does not fix it

Three things were measured while this module was being written, and two of
them contradict the folklore:

* **It is not only `simp`.**  A plain `show`/`rfl` detonates the same way: in
  `Ports/RamareWM217.lean` a `show 2 ≤ srun k s.regs (wmPre c) rN` — one
  structure projection away from the goal — reported `maximum recursion depth`
  because `isDefEq` walked into the 137-instruction run.  Any tactic that
  forces `whnf` into a `% M`-saturated term is enough; `simp` is merely the
  most common one.  The fix is the same either way: keep the state a
  *variable* (see `wmBody_post_defined` there) so there is nothing to walk
  into.
* **Do not raise `maxRecDepth` to cope.**  It converts a clean error into a
  slower one, and at large settings a failing check has been observed to abort
  the process outright rather than report.
* **Operand order is not the whole story.**  The "big numeral in second
  position unary-unfolds" rule is real, but it is not the only mechanism and
  reordering is not available to a port whose emitted C has already been
  compiled and run — changing the program changes the artifact.  This module
  exists so that the fix never has to touch the program.

A complementary technique, used on other ports in this package where the
*arithmetic itself* is the subject (encoding proofs, not definedness proofs):
parameterise each block by its constants as ordinary variables and bridge back
to the concrete block by `rfl`.  The numeral then never enters the goal at
all, and the program — hence the emitted C and its hash — is unchanged.  The
two approaches compose: use the parameterised form when the value matters, and
this module when only definedness does.

Everything here is generic: it mentions no port, no configuration, and no
constant.

**Evaluating one instruction, in three independent steps.**

The two operands are resolved separately — typically by `RegFrame.srun_frame`
on the left and `denoteOperand_lit_of_lt` on the right — and only then is the
operation applied, through one of the `denoteOp_*_of_*` lemmas below.  Because
each argument is named (`a`, `b`) before the operation is touched, the
program's constants appear only inside `hr` and inside the numeric side
condition of the operation lemma.  They are never rewritten *under* a `% M`,
which is the rewrite that unary-unfolds them.

/-! ## Branchless flags, at instruction level

Every port in this package materialises a condition as a `0`/`1` register.
`Verified/ArrayFoldBridge.lean` has the algebra of those flags once they are
already `if … then 1 else 0`; what is missing, and what a framing proof needs,
is the fact one step earlier: a *comparison instruction writes a flag*, and a
*product of flags is a flag*, whatever the operands are.  With those two, a
gate register can be case-split without evaluating anything that feeds it.
