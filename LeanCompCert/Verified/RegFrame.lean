# Reading one register through a long straight-line block

`Verified/InstrBlock.lean` gives a block its total meaning `srun`, and
`srun_untouched` says a register the block never writes keeps its value.  That
is the right fact, but in the form it is stated it does not compose through a
real port body:

* its hypothesis is `∀ i ∈ l, sdest i ≠ r`, a `Prop` over a list, so a port
  has to produce a membership proof rather than run a decision procedure; and
* the register a port needs to read is almost never *untouched*.  It is
  written once, early, and read much later — the weighted-moment sweep of
  `Ports/RamareWM217.lean` sets its trial divisor `rD` in the decode block and
  divides by it five instructions later, and its candidate `rN` in the same
  decode block and divides by it a hundred instructions later.

Pushed through `simp`, that read costs one `RegState.set` layer per
intervening instruction, and each layer drags the arithmetic of an unrelated
instruction into the normal form.  For the sweep above that is what trips
`(kernel) deep recursion detected`: the intervening instructions are the ones
carrying `2⁴⁸`-scale literals, and `simp` normalising `(reg ⊕ literal) % M`
unary-unfolds the literal (`Nat.add`/`Nat.mul` recurse on their **second**
argument).  Growing the simp set makes this strictly worse.

This module is the framing layer that removes the need for any of it.

## What it provides

* `writes r l : Bool` — "does this block write register `r`", a decidable
  test that inspects only `sdest`, i.e. only register *indices*.  Every side
  condition below is discharged by `by decide`, and the decision never looks
  inside an operand, so a block full of `2⁴⁸`-scale literals costs the same as
  an empty one.
* `srun_frame` — a block that does not write `r` leaves `r` alone.
* `srun_frame_append` — the same fact used as a *suffix* eraser: the value of
  `r` after `xs ++ ys` is its value after `xs`, whenever `ys` does not write
  it.
* `srun_read_write` — **the composition lemma the ports were missing**: the
  value of `r` after a block equals `sval` of the *last instruction that
  writes it*, evaluated at the state its own prefix reaches.  Everything after
  that write is framed away by one decidable check, and everything before it
  stays packaged as `srun k s xs` — an opaque term, not a tower of `set`s.

The resulting discipline, which `Verified/BlockDefined.lean` builds on: state
threading is *always* `srun k s prefix`, never nested `RegState.set`; a
register read is *always* `srun_read_write` followed by a value lemma about
one `denoteOp`.  No unrelated instruction's arithmetic ever enters the goal.

**Erasing a suffix.**  The value of `r` after `xs ++ ys` is its value after
`xs` alone, provided `ys` does not write `r`.  This is the form a port uses to
walk backwards from a read to the write that produced it.

/--
**Read after write — the composition lemma.**

If the block factors as `xs ++ i :: ys` with `i` writing `r` and `ys` not
writing it, then reading `r` at the end of the block is exactly `sval` of `i`
at the state `xs` reaches.  Both side conditions are decidable and mention
only register indices.

The point is what does *not* appear: the instructions of `ys` are erased by a
`decide`, and those of `xs` stay inside the opaque term `srun k s xs`.  A
`2⁴⁸`-scale literal in either one is never normalised, so it cannot unfold.

block is the write.

/--
The other special case: the write is the block's first instruction, so the
prefix is empty and the state is the entry state itself.

/-! ## Bounds carried through a block

`srun_lt_of_lt` already says every register stays a word.  These two are the
convenient packagings: a block preserves "every register is a word", and a
register read out of a block is a word.
